## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this project was to build a responsive four-card feature section that matches the provided design as closely as possible. It required accurate implementation of both layout and styles, as well as ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.

**Users should be able to:**
- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size.
- Navigate the website efficiently with proper accessibility features.
- Enjoy a visually appealing and responsive design.
